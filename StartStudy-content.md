## Content Strategy Notes

### Tone & Voice
- **Professional yet approachable:** Academic credibility with warm, parent-friendly language
- **Clear and concise:** Short descriptions that quickly communicate value
- **Action-oriented:** Links use verbs (Browse, Discover, Take, See, View)

### Key Messaging Principles
1. **Age-appropriate labeling:** Every program includes age ranges and grade equivalents
2. **Value propositions:** Each description highlights the unique benefit/focus
3. **Competitive differentiation:** "Get Ready" emphasized as "World's only" and "92% pass rate"
4. **Educational terminology:** Uses recognized terms (O-Level, IGCSE, FSc, Cambridge)
5. **Quick decision-making:** Users can identify their path in seconds

### Differentiation Hierarchy
1. **Primary highlight:** Get Ready Courses (featured twice, unique badge, statistics)
2. **Standard programs:** All other grade levels (equal visual weight)
3. **Subjects:** Clear, simple categorization
4. **Quick actions:** Easy access to trial/exploratory actions

### Content Updates & Maintenance
- **Pass rate statistics:** Update annually based on latest data
- **Age ranges:** Review annually to ensure accuracy with grade-level standards
- **Program names:** Keep consistent across all site areas
- **URLs:** Maintain stable URL structure; use redirects if changes needed

---

## SEO & Metadata Considerations

### Keywords Present
- Grade-specific terms: "O-Level", "IGCSE", "FSc", "Intermediate", "Primary"
- Subject names: "Mathematics", "English", "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology"
- Action terms: "Diagnostic test", "Sample lessons", "Courses"
- Location/board terms: "Cambridge curriculum", "Pakistan Board", "MDCAT", "ECAT"

### Internal Linking Strategy
- Primary programs: 6 grade-level program pages
- Subjects: 5 subject category pages + all courses page
- Support pages: Diagnostic, sample lessons, pricing
- Featured program: Get Ready (linked twice for emphasis)

### Content Accuracy
- Ensure all grade ranges align with actual program offerings
- Verify pass rate statistics are current and sourced
- Confirm subject availability matches course catalog
- Validate all URLs before deployment

---

## Accessibility Content Requirements

### Link Text Clarity
- All links have descriptive text (no "click here" or "learn more")
- Icon descriptions provided for visual context
- Consistent naming across menu and destination pages

### Readable Language
- Grade level: 8-10 (accessible to parents and older students)
- No unexplained jargon or acronyms
- Clear hierarchy with section headings

### Visual Content
- Icons supplement text (not replace)
- Emoji used for visual interest (not critical information)
- Badges use text + color (not color alone)

---

## Mobile Content Considerations

### Mobile Display
- All content visible in single-column format
- Age ranges may stack on very small screens
- Descriptions remain visible (not truncated)
- Icons scale appropriately

### Mobile-Specific Text (If Needed)
- All text remains the same on mobile
- No separate mobile content variants required
- Full descriptions visible (no "Read more" needed)

---

## Translation Readiness

### Translatable Elements
- All link text
- All descriptions
- All age ranges (adapt to local grade systems)
- Button CTAs
- Section headings

### Non-Translatable Elements
- URLs (keep in English)
- Icons (universal symbols)
- Badge text (may translate: "UNIQUE" → "منفرد" for Urdu)

### Cultural Adaptation Notes
- FSc/Intermediate is Pakistan-specific (may need equivalent for other markets)
- O-Level/IGCSE is UK/Cambridge system (recognized in many countries)
- Age ranges may need adjustment for different education systems
